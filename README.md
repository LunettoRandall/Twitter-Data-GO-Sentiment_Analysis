The data set here is twitter data about Go game of Google’s Aphago vs Se-Dol Lee, who is a Go champion. The game was held in March 12 – March 17 2016. Alphago won 4 out of 5 games – Se-Dol won the second game - so that Korean people and Go community were so shocked because they believed that Artificial Intelligence cannot beat human as Go is more complicated than Chess even though IBM Deep Blue defeated the chess champion in 1997. Since then, Korea and other Asian countries studied and have been focusing on AI industry.
